Various AutoHotKey scripts that I use. Some are original, some are modified from what I found online, some are purely from elsewhere. I've tried to remember to credit/link any that I've borrowed, but that doesn't always happen.

This repo's just kind of thrown together right now, I'll get around to cleaning it up and sorting it and such at some point. Just wanted to get it online as backup for now, mainly.
